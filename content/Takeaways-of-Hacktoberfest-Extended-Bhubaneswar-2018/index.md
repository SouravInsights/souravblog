### Important takeaways from¬†Hacktoberfest:

#### 1\. What is Open¬†Source?

Open Source Software is a computer software whose source code is made publicly available for modification and enhancements. It is released under various licenses like BSD, MIT etc. Read this article about ‚Äú[What is open source?](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)‚Äù

#### 2\. Recap of what we did in Git & GitHub workshop:

While we made sure that every attendees must have a Git cheat sheet but still I‚Äôd like to briefly mention the things we did in the event.

1.  [Create a new repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository) on **GitHub**. To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with _README_, license, or `gitignore` files. You can add these files after your project has been pushed to GitHub.

![Collected from: [https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/repo-create.png](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/repo-create.png)](./asset-8.png)

2\. Go to your project directory and CD into it.

3\. Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.

```
$ git init
```

4\. Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.

```
$ git add .
```

5\. Commit the files that you‚Äôve staged in your local repository.

```
$ git commit -m ‚ÄúFirst commit‚Äù
# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. 
```

6\. At the top of your GitHub repository‚Äôs Quick Setup page, click to copy the remote repository URL.

![](./asset-9.png)

7\. In the Command prompt, [add the URL for the remote repository](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-remote) where your local repository will be pushed.

```
$ git remote add origin remote repository URL
# Sets the new remote
```

8\. [Push the changes](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote) in your local repository to **GitHub**.

```
$ git push origin master
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin
```

#### 3\. Hacktoberfest Outline: ( What participants did?¬†)

We had prepared a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Emisha-GITA/Demo-Portfolio-Website) called `Demo Portfolio Website` with some beginner level issues where around 92 pull requests got generated by the participants.

![The repo that we used in Hactoberfest](./asset-10.png)

But this contribution didn‚Äôt mean much in the open source world. They needed to know about the real issues from open source projects that matter. So we talked more about how to find issues in GitHub, how _labels_ help, how we can filter issues by labels or languages. ( Check out this [website](http://issuehub.io/) to easily search issue labels to find the right project for you. )
